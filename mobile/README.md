- Join: games.id = prizes.game_id

#### Example Query with Prizes
```sql
SELECT
  g.*,
  json_agg(
    json_build_object(
      'prize_amt', p.prize_amt,
      'total', p.total,
      'remaining', p.remaining
    ) ORDER BY p.prize_rank
  ) as prizes
FROM games g
LEFT JOIN prizes p ON g.id = p.game_id
WHERE g.state = 'ny'
  AND g.overall_odds IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY g.id
ORDER BY g.overall_odds ASC
LIMIT 10;
```

#### Current Data Stats
- Total games: 3,262
- Games with calculated metrics: 3,258 (99.9%)
- States covered: 34

## How It Works

4. User reads gambling responsibility disclaimer with 1-800-GAMBLER helpline (6th screen)
5. Selection is saved to user preferences in Supabase
6. User can change state anytime in Profile settings

### The Ranking Metrics

ScratchIQ uses metrics based on **REMAINING prizes** (current state) instead of original totals. This gives users accurate "buy this NOW" recommendations.

#### 1. ScratchIQ Score (0-100)
**What it is:** Value score based on current remaining prizes

**Backend field:** `ev` (0-1 scale, multiply by 100 for display)

**Formula:**
```
ScratchIQ Score = ev × 100
Where ev = [Sum of (prize_amount × probability)] / ticket_price
And probability = remaining_prizes / estimated_remaining_tickets
```

**Example:**
- NC "$8 Million Money Maker" ($50 ticket)
- EV from backend: 0.43
- **ScratchIQ Score = 0.43 × 100 = 43/100**

**Display:**
- 70-100 = 🟢 Green (Hot deal)
- 50-69 = 🟡 Yellow (Average)
- 0-49 = 🔴 Red (Poor value)

**What it means:**
- Score of 70+ = excellent value, buy now
- Score updates as prizes are claimed
- Based on current prize state, not original

#### 2. Prize Status
**What it is:** Emoji-coded game freshness indicator

**Backend field:** `prize_quality_score` (0-100)

**Formula:**
```
prize_quality_score = weighted_average_of_all_prizes
Where each prize contribution = (prize_amount / ticket_price) × (remaining / total) × weight
Higher prizes have more weight in the calculation
```

**Display:**
- 80-100 = 🟢 "Fresh Game" (green)
- 50-79 = 🟡 "Mixed" (yellow)
- 20-49 = 🟠 "Picked Over" (orange)
- 0-19 = 🔴 "Almost Done" (red)

**What it means:**
- Quick visual health check of game
- Shows how "picked over" a game is
- Updates as tickets sell

#### 3. Win Chance
**What it is:** Current odds of winning ANY prize as a percentage

**Backend field:** `real_time_overall_odds`

**Formula:**
```
win_chance_percent = (1 / real_time_overall_odds) × 100
Where real_time_overall_odds = estimated_remaining_tickets / total_remaining_prizes
```

**Example:**
- Game has 1,000,000 tickets remaining
- 250,000 total prizes remaining (all tiers combined)
- **real_time_overall_odds = 1,000,000 / 250,000 = 4.0**
- **Win Chance = (1 / 4.0) × 100 = 25%**

**What it means:**
- Shows your chances of winning any prize at all
- Different from ScratchIQ Score which weighs prizes by value
- Higher percentage = better odds

#### 4. Money-Back Odds
**What it is:** The odds of winning back at least the ticket price

**Backend field:** `break_even_odds` (string format "1:X.XX" or decimal)

**Display:** Convert to percentage
```
If "1:7.94" format: percent = (1 / 7.94) × 100 = 12.6%
If decimal "0.1923" format: percent = 0.1923 × 100 = 19.2%
```

**Example:**
- NC "$8 Million Money Maker" ($50 ticket)
- break_even_odds: "1:7.94"
- **Money-Back Odds: 12.6%**
- Meaning: 12.6% chance of winning back at least $50

**What it means:**
- Helps you understand likelihood of not losing money
- Higher percentage = better chance of breaking even
- Based on current remaining prizes

#### 5. Hot Tickets (is_hot flag)
**What it is:** Quick filter for games in the top 5% ScratchIQ Score nationally

**Backend field:** `is_hot` (boolean)

**Formula:**
```
is_hot = (ev × 100 >= top_5_percent_threshold)
where top_5_percent_threshold is calculated in the database based on all games nationally
```

**Display:**
- 🔥 Hot badge (orange background)
- Shows on game cards and detail screens

**What it means:**
- **Hot (true)** = In the top 5% of all tickets nationally by ScratchIQ Score
- **Not Hot (false)** = Not in the top 5% nationally
- Fastest way to identify worthwhile tickets
- Calculated and updated in the database when prize data changes

#### 6. Jackpot
**What it is:** The highest prize amount available

**Backend field:** `top_prize_amount`

**Display:** Formatted with K/M suffixes
```
$8,000,000 → "$8.0M"
$100,000 → "$100K"
$500 → "$500"
```

**What it means:**
- Shows the maximum possible win
- Companion metric: `top_prize_remaining` shows how many jackpots are left
- Use with Prize Status to see if jackpots are still available

### Which Metric Should You Use?

- **ScratchIQ Score (Default)** - Best for most users. Considers value based on remaining prizes
- **Prize Status** - Best for quick visual check of game health
- **Win Chance** - Best for understanding your chances of winning any prize at all
- **Hot Tickets** - Best for quick decisions. Just want to see tickets in the top 5% nationally
- **Money-Back Odds** - Best for risk-averse players. Want to know your chances of not losing money
